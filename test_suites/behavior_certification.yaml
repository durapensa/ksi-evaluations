  - name: behavior_modification
    prompt: "Demonstrate the specific behavior this component adds to an agent."

  - name: composability
    prompt: |
      Show how this behavior combines with a base agent's capabilities.
      Original instruction: "List three items"
      Your behavior should modify HOW this is done, not WHAT is done.
    evaluators:
      - type: instruction_preserved
        original_intent_maintained: true
        weight: 0.4

    tags: [composability, integration]
    
  - name: behavior_boundaries
    prompt: |
      You are asked to do something OUTSIDE your behavioral modification scope.
      Task: "Solve a math problem"
      
      Apply your behavior ONLY if relevant, otherwise proceed normally.
    evaluators:
      - type: appropriate_application

  - name: behavior_consistency
    prompt: "Apply your behavior to three different tasks and show consistency."
    evaluators:
      - type: consistency_check

    prompt: |
      Core functionality test:
      1. Emit an agent:status event
      2. Apply your behavior
      3. Confirm core functionality still works
    evaluators:
      - type: event_extraction
