description: Schema for any judge communicating with Meta-Judge for oversight

schema_documentation: |
  The Meta-Judge serves as system overseer with circuit breaker authority.
  Any judge can send messages to Meta-Judge for:
  - Constitutional constraint checks
  - Anomaly reporting
  - Resource limit warnings
  - Consensus failures
  - System health concerns
  
  Meta-Judge responses can HALT the entire pipeline if necessary.
