description: Schema for Analyst Judge sending analysis to Rewriter Judge

schema_documentation: |
  After analyzing a failure, the Analyst Judge sends this detailed diagnosis
  to the Rewriter Judge. The Rewriter uses this information to create an
  improved prompt that addresses the identified issues while preserving
  the original intent.
